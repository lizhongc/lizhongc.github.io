== About me
I am a research officer in [https://www.wehi.edu.au/people/gordon-smyth Prof. Gordon K Smyth] lab team at Bioinformatics Division, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research (WEHI). I completed my PhD degree in Statistics from the University of Melbourne under the supervision of [https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/144561-guoqi-qian A/Prof. Guoqi Qian], Prof. Yuriy Kuleshov and [https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/795463-tingjin-chu Dr. Tingjin Chu] in Jul. 2022. I received my M.S. and B.S. in Mathematics from Peking University on Jun. 2016 and Jul. 2013, respectively.

== Presentations 
- edgeR quasi-likelihood: correcting deviance for bias, 2022, WEHI Bioinformatics Divsion seminar
- Extending edgeR for small counts and large samples, 2023, WEHI Bioinformatics Divsion seminar
- Applying edgeR for alternative splicing analysis, 2024, WEHI Bioinformatics Divsion seminar

== Softwares
- R package: edgeR (Empirical Analysis of Digital Gene Expression Data in R) \n
We develop the new quasi-likelihood method for differential expression analysis using the exact calculation for unit deviance of Negative Binomial distribution. It is available on [https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html R-Bioconductor].
- R package: statmod (statmod: Statistical Modeling) \n 
We make the exact distributional calculations for unit deviances of Binomial, Poisson and Negative Binomial distributions. It is available on [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/statmod/index.html R-CRAN].
- R package: IBGS (Iterated Blockwise Gibbs Sampler) \n
IBGS is an MCMC search algorithm designed to find the best model in the high dimensional data given a model selection criterion such as AIC, BIC and so on. Moreover, it can identify those most important covariates having the significant influence on the response. It is available on [https://github.com/lizhongc/IBGS Github].
